            <p>
                The Duelist deck focuses on precision, agility, and calculated strikes, utilizing the unique <strong>Flow Mechanic</strong>. Flow is activated by playing a card that is not the first in a turn, triggering additional effects or follow-ups. This mechanic rewards strategic planning and adaptability, allowing Duelists to chain abilities together for devastating combos. Gameplay revolves around maintaining Flow, countering opponents’ actions, and exploiting openings to outmaneuver and dismantle foes with finesse.
