                <p>
                    The Duelist deck focuses on precision, agility, and calculated strikes, utilizing the unique Flow Mechanic. Flow is activated by playing a card that is not the first in a turn, triggering additional effects or follow-ups. This mechanic rewards strategic planning and adaptability, allowing Duelists to chain abilities together for devastating combos. Gameplay revolves around maintaining Flow, countering opponentsâ€™ actions, and exploiting openings to outmaneuver and dismantle foes with finesse.
