            <p>
                The Bard deck revolves around composing melodies using Note Cards from various music genres, each with unique effects. Players gradually craft songs that can be "released" as a quick or normal action for powerful effects. Each genre corresponds to a distinct gameplay mechanic, offering buffs, debuffs, or situational advantages. The Bard’s gameplay emphasizes creativity and synergy, rewarding strategic composition and timing to influence the battlefield and support allies or hinder foes.

            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Bard</strong> is a creative and adaptive class, using <strong>Note Cards</strong> (C, D, E, F, G) to compose powerful <strong>Songs</strong> that provide diverse effects. Each <strong>Note Card</strong> belongs to one of 10 musical categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pop:</strong> Healing effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Rock:</strong> Physical damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Jazz:</strong> Utility and AP manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Classical:</strong> Defense and buffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy Metal:</strong> Debuffs.</li>
                <li><strong>Country:</strong> Self-sustain.</li>
                <li><strong>Electronic:</strong> Movement and speed enhancements.</li>
                <li><strong>Blues:</strong> Damage-over-time (DoT).</li>
                <li><strong>Folk:</strong> Summons and ally support.</li>
                <li><strong>Punk:</strong> Discard and hand manipulation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Bard’s unique mechanic, <strong>Song Composition</strong>, involves playing Note Cards onto the board to create an array of cards, forming a Song. Notes gain additional effects depending on the sequence of previous Notes in the Song (e.g., "If the previous Notes are C, F, heals 5 HP to the target"). The Bard can compose multiple Songs simultaneously and play them as either <strong>Normal Actions</strong> or <strong>Quick Actions</strong>, depending on their strategic needs.

            <h3>🏁 Early Game:</h3>
            <p>
