                <p>
                    The Bard deck revolves around composing melodies using Note Cards from various music genres, each with unique effects. Players gradually craft songs that can be "released" as a quick or normal action for powerful effects. Each genre corresponds to a distinct gameplay mechanic, offering buffs, debuffs, or situational advantages. The Bardâ€™s gameplay emphasizes creativity and synergy, rewarding strategic composition and timing to influence the battlefield and support allies or hinder foes.
