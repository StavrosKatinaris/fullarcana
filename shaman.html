            <h2>⛈️ Deck Mechanics and Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The Shaman deck channels the forces of nature and the spiritual realm, leveraging Weather Effects and Spiritual Totems to shape the battlefield. The Shaman has a single Weather Slot, where Weather Manipulation cards remain active and can only be replaced by another Weather Manipulation card—they cannot be discarded otherwise. Weather Effects create global changes that impact all players, while Spiritual Totems provide passive buffs or trigger specific effects. Gameplay revolves around maintaining control through strategic weather manipulation and spiritual synergy to outlast or overwhelm foes.
