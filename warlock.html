                <p>
                    The Warlock deck thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies, wielding curses, life-draining spells, and devastating apocalyptic effects. The deck introduces Spell Slots, allowing players to keep up to five active spells on the battlefield, each with limited uses. Many Warlock cards require sacrificing HP or discarding cards, emphasizing resource management and tactical decision-making. Gameplay revolves around building momentum through curses and life taps while timing devastating effects to overwhelm opponents and seize control of the battlefield.
