            <h2>🌟 Deck Mechanics and Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The Warlock deck thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies, wielding curses, life-draining spells, and devastating apocalyptic effects. The deck introduces Spell Slots, allowing players to keep up to five active spells on the battlefield, each with limited uses. Many Warlock cards require sacrificing HP or discarding cards, emphasizing resource management and tactical decision-making. Gameplay revolves around building momentum through curses and life taps while timing devastating effects to overwhelm opponents and seize control of the battlefield.

            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Warlock</strong> relies on managing Spell Slots and leveraging curses to dominate the battlefield. Each turn, you can place up to five active spells in your Spell Slots, enabling sustained effects or devastating one-time abilities. Sacrificing HP and cards is essential to power your apocalyptic spells, but balance is critical to avoid leaving yourself vulnerable. Early game, focus on setting curses to weaken enemies and building resources. Mid-game, sustain yourself with life taps while maintaining constant pressure. Late-game, unleash devastating combos and high-cost spells to overwhelm your opponent and seize victory.
