                <p>
                    Players compete individually or in teams, using unique class-based decks. The goal is to <strong>eliminate opponents</strong> by reducing their HP to zero or to outlast all other players/teams. The last player or team remaining with HP wins the game.

                <h2>🛠️ Game Setup</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>📜 Deck Selection:</strong> Choose a class-based deck aligned with a character archetype (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue). Each deck has 50 cards designed for that class’s strengths and playstyle.</li>
                    <li><strong>❤️ Health Points (HP):</strong> Start with 100 HP. Track HP using tokens, counters, or a score sheet.</li>
                    <li><strong>⚡ Action Points (AP):</strong> Start each turn with 7 AP to spend on card actions. Cards indicate their AP cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>🃏 Initial Hand:</strong> Draw 5 cards at the start of the game.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🔍 Advanced Combat Mechanics</h2>
                <h3>🛡️ Damage System and Flow</h3>
                <p>
                    Damage involves calculations of attack power, defense, block, and success hits to determine the impact. Here's an example:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Damage Dealt:</strong> A card like <em>Malefic Bond</em> deals 40 damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defense Reduction:</strong> The target has 20 defense, reducing damage to 20 (40 - 20 = 20).</li>
                    <li><strong>Block Application:</strong> The target has 10 block, reducing damage to 10 (20 - 10 = 10).</li>
                    <li><strong>Success Hit:</strong> The remaining 10 damage reduces the target’s HP.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>🎯 Targeting Defense and Specialized Defenses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Targeting Defense:</strong> Some cards, like <em>Divine Strike</em>, deal damage directly to defense without affecting HP, weakening defenses for follow-up attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialized Defenses:</strong> Certain defenses block specific damage types. For example, <em>Enchanted Armor</em> blocks only magical damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>⏰ Effect Resolution Timing</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Start of Turn:</strong> Effects resolve in this order: AP buffs, AP reductions, AP debuffs, AP regeneration, defense buffs, defense debuffs, and crowd control effects (e.g., stuns).<br>
                    <strong>End of Turn:</strong> Health-related effects resolve, including healing-over-time (HoT) and damage-over-time (DoT) effects.
