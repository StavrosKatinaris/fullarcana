            <p>
                The Hunter deck combines ranged precision, tracking abilities, and the aid of animal companions to control the battlefield. Animal Companions act as reaction cards, triggering effects based on specific circumstances, while Tracking and Marking cards amplify damage and enhance other abilities. The Hunter’s arsenal provides varied attack types and utility options, allowing for adaptability in combat. Gameplay focuses on leveraging companions, exploiting marked targets, and maintaining control through strategic use of traps and ranged attacks.
