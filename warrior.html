                <p>
                    The Warrior deck revolves around managing two Hand Slots and one Style Slot. Equipment cards, 
                    such as one-handed or two-handed weapons, shields, and tools, occupy the Hand Slots. The Style 
                    Slot allows for equipping a Style Technique, which provides passive buffs or alters gameplay 
                    mechanics (e.g., dual-wielding or two-handed weapons requiring only one slot). The Warriorâ€™s 
                    gameplay focuses on balancing offensive and defensive equipment while executing powerful Techniques 
                    to overwhelm or outlast opponents.

                    <strong>Utility:</strong> 4/10 - Limited utility, focusing mainly on direct combat rather than support or control.<br>

                <h2>Class Guide</h2>
                <h3>Early Game:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Equip key gear quickly (e.g., a balanced weapon and shield/armor). Use low-AP techniques to establish your defense and generate tempo.<br>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong> Prioritize techniques that enhance survivability, like Defensive Guard, to avoid taking early damage.
                </div>
                <h3>Mid Game:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Transition to more aggressive strategies. Equip stronger gear like two-handed weapons if the situation allows.<br>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong> Use synergy between style techniques (e.g., Dual Wielding Mastery) and offensive techniques (Sweeping Blow, Heavy Chop) to deal consistent damage.
                </div>
                <h3>Late Game:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Execute powerful combos using legendary techniques (Indomitable Resolve, Final Stand). Shift between offense and defense as needed to control the battlefield.<br>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong> Maintain flexibility with your equipment to counter specific opponents. For example, equip Spiked Shield for counterattacks against melee enemies or Reflective Armor for magic resistance.
                </div>
                <h3>Playstyle Tips:</h3>
                <div class="list">

                    <strong>Technique Slot Management:</strong> Use your slot wisely to enhance synergy with your equipped weapons and shield. For instance, Charge Attack pairs well with two-handed weapons, while Shield Slam benefits from defensive builds.<br>
                    <strong>Legendary Techniques:</strong> These are your game-changers. Use them strategically to swing the game in your favor.
