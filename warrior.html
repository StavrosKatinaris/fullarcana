            <h2>⚔️ Deck Mechanics and Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The Warrior deck revolves around managing two Hand Slots and one Style Slot. Equipment cards, such as one-handed or two-handed weapons, shields, and tools, occupy the Hand Slots. The Style Slot allows for equipping a Style Technique, which provides passive buffs or alters gameplay mechanics (e.g., dual-wielding or two-handed weapons requiring only one slot). The Warrior’s gameplay focuses on balancing offensive and defensive equipment while executing powerful Techniques to overwhelm or outlast opponents.

            <h2>📜 Class Guide</h2>
            <h3>🏁 Early Game:</h3>
            <p>
                Focus: Equip key gear quickly (e.g., a balanced weapon and shield/armor). Use low-AP techniques to establish your defense and generate tempo.<br>
                Tips: Prioritize techniques that enhance survivability, like Defensive Guard, to avoid taking early damage.
            </p>
            <h3>⚔️ Mid Game:</h3>
            <p>
                Focus: Transition to more aggressive strategies. Equip stronger gear like two-handed weapons if the situation allows.<br>
                Tips: Use synergy between style techniques (e.g., Dual Wielding Mastery) and offensive techniques (Sweeping Blow, Heavy Chop) to deal consistent damage.
            </p>
            <h3>🔥 Late Game:</h3>
            <p>
                Focus: Execute powerful combos using legendary techniques (Indomitable Resolve, Final Stand). Shift between offense and defense as needed to control the battlefield.<br>
                Tips: Maintain flexibility with your equipment to counter specific opponents. For example, equip Spiked Shield for counterattacks against melee enemies or Reflective Armor for magic resistance.
