                <p>
                    The Barbarian deck thrives on raw aggression and unrelenting fury, powered by the unique Rage Mechanic. Rage builds as the Barbarian takes or deals damage, unlocking stronger effects and amplifying the power of key cards. The deck focuses on high-damage attacks, self-sacrificial abilities, and relentless pressure to overpower opponents. Gameplay emphasizes an aggressive tempo, managing Rage to execute devastating combos while balancing survivability to sustain the onslaught.
