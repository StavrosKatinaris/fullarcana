            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Barbarian</strong> thrives on raw power and relentless aggression, utilizing <strong>Attack Cards</strong>, <strong>Battle Cry Cards</strong>, and <strong>Rage Mechanics</strong> to dominate the battlefield. The deck revolves around generating and spending <strong>Rage Points (RP)</strong>, which accumulate as the Barbarian takes or deals damage. <strong>Attack Cards</strong> deliver high-damage blows, often requiring RP to activate their strongest effects. <strong>Battle Cry Cards</strong> enhance your offense, defense, or resource management, often scaling with your current RP. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Barbarian’s unique mechanic, <strong>Rage Management</strong>, requires balancing the generation and expenditure of RP to maintain momentum. Early in the game, focus on building RP by using low-cost attacks and generating tempo with utility cards. In the mid-game, use <strong>Savage Blows</strong> and <strong>Battle Cries</strong> to capitalize on your accumulated RP, delivering devastating combos while mitigating threats. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the late game, unleash your <strong>Pure Rage Finishers</strong> to overwhelm opponents. The Barbarian rewards a high-risk, high-reward playstyle, where timing and aggression are critical to victory.
