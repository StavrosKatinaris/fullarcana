                <p>
                    The Alchemist deck revolves around Potion Crafting, combining Ingredient Cards to create powerful Potions. Ingredients provide small, individual effects but must be played without using their effects to craft Potions, which are then activated for healing, damage, buffs, or utility. Once infused into a Potion, Ingredients are returned to the card pile, ensuring resource recycling. The Alchemist can store 1-2 completed Potions for strategic use. Gameplay emphasizes careful ingredient management, crafting impactful Potions, and timing their use to control the battlefield effectively.
