            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Alchemist</strong> is a master of potion crafting, leveraging <strong>Ingredient Cards</strong> and <strong>Potion Cards</strong> to adapt to any situation. The deck includes <strong>Ingredients</strong>, <strong>Potions</strong> and <strong>Utility Cards</strong> that enhance crafting or disrupt opponents. To craft a potion, you must play the required <strong>Ingredient Cards</strong> without using their effects, then follow up by playing the corresponding <strong>Potion Card</strong>, which activates a powerful effect like healing, buffs, debuffs, or damage. Once ingredients are infused into a potion, they return to the card pile, ensuring resource recycling. The Alchemist also has access to <strong>Alchemy Utility Cards</strong>, which allow actions like drawing extra cards, retrieving discarded ingredients, or amplifying potion effects. Timing is crucial—craft potions early to prepare for long-term adaptability and use high-impact potions like "Apothecary’s Brew" during pivotal moments. The Alchemist’s unique mechanic, <strong>Potion Crafting</strong>, rewards strategic planning, resource management, and clever combinations to dominate the battlefield.</p>
