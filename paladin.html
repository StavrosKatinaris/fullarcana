            <h2>🌟 Deck Mechanics and Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The Paladin deck embodies divine balance, combining offense, defense, and support through three unique active slots: Aura System, Judgment and Vows, and Faith and Divine Intercession. Auras provide passive benefits to allies or penalties to enemies, while Judgments and Vows establish criteria for powerful effects. Faith and Divine Intercession cards invoke godly blessings, offering strong buffs or game-changing utilities. The Paladin’s gameplay focuses on maintaining equilibrium, using divine abilities to protect allies, punish foes, and adapt to any situation.

            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Paladin</strong> utilizes 3 distinct slots to manage their abilities: <strong>1 Aura System slot</strong>, <strong>1 Judgment and Vows slot</strong>, and <strong>1 Faith and Divine Intercession slot</strong>. Each slot holds one active card from its corresponding category. Mastering the right combination of these slots allows the Paladin to shift roles seamlessly, transforming into a resilient tank, a supportive debuffer, or a powerful damage dealer. While capable of dealing significant damage, the Paladin truly excels in defense and survivability, making them the ultimate protector on the battlefield.
