                <p>
                    The Paladin deck embodies divine balance, combining offense, defense, and support through three unique active slots: Aura System, Judgment and Vows, and Faith and Divine Intercession. Auras provide passive benefits to allies or penalties to enemies, while Judgments and Vows establish criteria for powerful effects. Faith and Divine Intercession cards invoke godly blessings, offering strong buffs or game-changing utilities. The Paladin’s gameplay focuses on maintaining equilibrium, using divine abilities to protect allies, punish foes, and adapt to any situation.
