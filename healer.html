            <p>
                The Healer deck excels at sustaining allies and countering damage through potent healing, buffs, and strategic utility. The deck introduces the <strong>Holy Essence</strong> resource, which is generated by specific cards and empowers others to deliver enhanced effects. Healers must balance restoring health, applying buffs to fortify allies, and removing debuffs from the battlefield. With a mix of healing spells, Holy Damage, and utility cards, the Healer’s gameplay revolves around resourceful planning and supporting their strategy while occasionally turning defense into offense.
