                <p>
                    The Healer deck excels at sustaining allies and countering damage through potent healing, buffs, and strategic utility. The deck introduces the Holy Essence resource, which is generated by specific cards and empowers others to deliver enhanced effects. Healers must balance restoring health, applying buffs to fortify allies, and removing debuffs from the battlefield. With a mix of healing spells, Holy Damage, and utility cards, the Healer’s gameplay revolves around resourceful planning and supporting their strategy while occasionally turning defense into offense.

                    <strong>Positioning:</strong> Keep the Healer protected. Cards like Guardian’s Shield can help mitigate damage to ensure survivability.
