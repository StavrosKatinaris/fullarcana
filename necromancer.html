                <p>
                    The Necromancer deck thrives on manipulating the graveyard and summoning powerful minions to dominate the battlefield. Cards in the deck synergize with discarded cards, allowing the Necromancer to recycle resources or fuel devastating abilities. Minion cards act as persistent effects, requiring careful management to maximize their impact while maintaining control of the board. Gameplay focuses on building a growing undead army, leveraging the discard pile for advantage, and overwhelming opponents with relentless pressure and strategic recursion.
