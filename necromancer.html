            <p>
                The Necromancer deck thrives on manipulating the graveyard and summoning powerful minions to dominate the battlefield. Cards in the deck synergize with discarded cards, allowing the Necromancer to recycle resources or fuel devastating abilities. Minion cards act as persistent effects, requiring careful management to maximize their impact while maintaining control of the board. Gameplay focuses on building a growing undead army, leveraging the discard pile for advantage, and overwhelming opponents with relentless pressure and strategic recursion.

            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Necromancer</strong> focuses on summoning walkers and utilizing the discard pile to gain an advantage. Early game, prioritize creating walkers and managing your resources efficiently. Walkers stay on the board until an opponent kills them, providing both offensive and defensive value. The Necromancer can have as many walkers active as they like, making it essential to grow your undead army. Mid-game, strengthen your undead forces and apply consistent pressure using discard pile mechanics. Late-game, unleash powerful cards that capitalize on your walkers and discard synergy to overwhelm opponents. The Necromancer rewards strategic timing and careful resource management.
