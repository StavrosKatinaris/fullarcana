            <p>
                The Druid deck harnesses the power of nature’s cycles, with card effects changing dynamically based on the current season: <strong>Spring</strong>, <strong>Summer</strong>, <strong>Fall</strong>, or <strong>Winter</strong>. Each season influences the Druid’s abilities, providing unique bonuses and strategic opportunities. Cards like Life Cards—such as <em>“Birth”</em> and <em>“Death”</em>—offer special effects tied to the natural rhythm. Gameplay focuses on adapting to the changing seasons, leveraging their unique benefits, and maintaining a balance between offensive, defensive, and utility effects.

            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Druid</strong> utilizes seasonal mechanics to adapt to the flow of battle. Cards change their effects based on the current season, making timing and planning crucial. At the start of each turn, the season naturally progresses in a set cycle: Spring → Summer → Fall → Winter. Early game focuses on establishing the active season with cards like <em>Spring Awakening</em> or <em>Autumn’s Decay</em>. Mid-game, balance healing, damage-over-time, and utility to dominate the battlefield with cards like <em>Summer’s Fury</em> and <em>Winter’s Embrace</em>. Late-game strategy involves leveraging powerful Life Cards <em>Birth</em> & <em>Death</em> to deliver impactful buffs, healing, or damage. Success depends on your ability to align your actions with the active season and adapt to shifting circumstances.
