                <p>
                    The Druid deck harnesses the power of nature’s cycles, with card effects changing dynamically based on the current season: Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter. Each season influences the Druid’s abilities, providing unique bonuses and strategic opportunities. Cards like Life Cards—such as “Birth” and “Death”—offer special effects tied to the natural rhythm. Gameplay focuses on adapting to the changing seasons, leveraging their unique benefits, and maintaining a balance between offensive, defensive, and utility effects.
