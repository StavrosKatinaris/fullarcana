            <p>
                The <strong>Artificer</strong> is a biomechanical innovator, utilizing <strong>Gadget Cards</strong>, <strong>Prosthetic Cards</strong>, and <strong>Utility Cards</strong> to dominate the battlefield. The deck revolves around <strong>Prosthetics</strong>, which provide powerful, persistent effects but often come with limitations or activation costs, and <strong>Gadgets</strong>, which offer temporary, versatile effects such as damage, defense, or utility boosts. The Artificer’s unique mechanic, <strong>Overclock</strong>, allows you to exceed your Action Point (AP) limit, but at the cost of taking damage for every AP spent beyond the maximum. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To succeed, you must balance resource management, tactical decision-making, and risk-taking. Start by equipping key <strong>Prosthetics</strong> to scale your abilities and establish a solid foundation. Use <strong>Utility Cards</strong> to adapt to threats, such as disrupting opponents or drawing additional cards. As the game progresses, deploy <strong>Scaling Gadgets</strong> to enhance your active prosthetics or execute devastating combos. Finally, unleash your most powerful effects to turn the tide of battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Artificer rewards players who think several steps ahead, synergizing gadgets and prosthetics for exponential power while mitigating the risks of overextending.
