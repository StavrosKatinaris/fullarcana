                <p>
                    The Artificer deck combines ingenuity and mechanical prowess, leveraging Gadget Cards and Prosthetics to adapt to any situation. Gadgets provide versatile effects, ranging from utility and defense to damage and resource generation. Prosthetics offer powerful, persistent enhancements that augment the Artificer’s abilities but come with limitations or activation costs. The Artificer can use any number of Action Points (AP), but surpassing the max AP limit costs HP per AP over the maximum. Gameplay revolves around constructing a mechanical arsenal, managing resources efficiently, and using innovative solutions to outwit and overwhelm opponents.
