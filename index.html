                <p>
                    Welcome to Full Arcana, a turn-based card game where strategy and class abilities decide your path to victory. Here’s everything you need to dive into the gameplay!
                </p>

            <section class="rules-section">
                <h2>❤️ 1. Hit Points (HP)</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> HP represents your character’s life force. If your HP drops to 0, you’re out of the game.<br>
                    <strong>Starting HP:</strong> Every class begins with 100 HP unless specified otherwise by class mechanics or effects.<br>
                    <strong>Damage:</strong> Incoming attacks reduce HP. Certain effects may cause healing to restore lost HP but cannot exceed your starting HP unless explicitly stated.<br>
                    <strong>Death:</strong> Once your HP hits 0, you cannot take any further actions.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="rules-section">
                <h2>⚡ 2. Action Points (AP)</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> AP is the currency used to play cards. Each card has an AP cost, which must be paid to activate it.<br>
                    <strong>Starting AP:</strong> All players begin with 7 AP unless their class specifies otherwise.<br>
                    <strong>Regeneration:</strong> At the start of each turn, your AP resets to its maximum value.<br>
                    <strong>Overload:</strong> If you attempt to spend more AP than you have, penalties or specific mechanics may apply (e.g., damage to self).
                </p>

                <h2>🃏 3. Drawing Cards</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hand Limit:</strong> Players may hold up to 10 cards by default, but class abilities or effects can modify this limit.<br>
                    <strong>Draw Phase:</strong> At the start of the game, draw 5 cards and up to 2 cards at the start of your turn unless otherwise stated.<br>
                    <strong>Deck Management:</strong> When your deck runs out of cards, shuffle your discard pile to create a new deck. Certain classes (like the Necromancer) can manipulate this pile for strategic advantage.

                <h2>⏱️ 4. Card Timing</h2>
                <p>
                    Cards have different timing windows, affecting when they can be used:<br>
                    <strong>Normal/Cast:</strong> These cards are played during your turn.<br>
                    <strong>Quick:</strong> These cards can be played during any enemy’s turn when targeting you or an ally.<br>
                    <strong>Permanent:</strong> These cards remain in play indefinitely, providing ongoing effects.
                </p>

                <h2>🎲 5. Initiation Roll and Turn Order</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Initiation Roll:</strong> At the start of each turn, all players roll a die (D20). The player with the highest roll chooses their position in the turn order (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The second-highest roller selects next, and so on.<br>
                    <strong>Dynamic Play:</strong> Certain cards or effects (like the Wizard’s Temporal Manipulations) may change the turn order mid-game, adding strategic depth.
