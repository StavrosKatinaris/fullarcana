                <h2>Deck Mechanics and Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mage deck revolves around harnessing six schools of arcane power: Aether, Arcana, Magnus, Psyche, Animus, and Chronos. With no slot restrictions, Mages prioritize casting spells that range from offensive attacks to defensive barriers and utility effects. Resource management is crucial, as powerful spells require strategic allocation of Action Points (AP). The Mage’s gameplay emphasizes versatility and adaptability, allowing players to manipulate the battlefield, counter opponents’ moves, and unleash devastating combinations of spells to secure victory.

                <p>
                    The Mage is a master of arcane arts, specializing in high-impact spells and strategic manipulation. It excels at area damage, utility, and controlling the battlefield, but it’s fragile and requires careful resource management.

                    <strong>Defense:</strong> 4/10 - Limited defensive options; primarily relies on avoidance and crowd control.<br>
                    <strong>Utility:</strong> 9/10 - Exceptional utility with spells that manipulate AP, card draws, and turn order.<br>
                    <strong>Complexity:</strong> 9/10 - High complexity due to the variety of effects and the need for precise resource management.<br>
                    <strong>Synergy:</strong> 8/10 - Strong synergy between spells and the Lore mechanic, which amplifies card power.<br>
                    <strong>Tempo:</strong> 5/10 - Slow to moderate tempo due to high AP costs but capable of explosive turns.<br>

                <h2>Class Guide</h2>
                <h3>Early Game:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Set up for long-term success by using resource-boosting spells (e.g., Cosmic Potential) to increase max AP or card draw.<br>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong> Avoid overcommitting to early damage; prioritize control and sustainability.
                </div>
                <h3>Mid Game:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Transition to impactful spells that can turn the tide of battle. Use area damage (Meteor Strike) and utility spells (Temporal Stasis) to control the board.<br>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong> Combine damage-dealing spells with utility to maximize efficiency. For example, use Arcane Torrent to damage multiple enemies while reducing their AP.
                </div>
                <h3>Late Game:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Focus:</strong> Unleash your most powerful spells using Lore to amplify their effects. Utilize your legendary spells to finish the game.<br>
                    <strong>Tips:</strong> Time your high-cost cards like Celestial Devastation carefully, ensuring you have enough AP to capitalize on their effects.
                </div>
                <h3>Playstyle Tips:</h3>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Master Resource Management:</strong> The Mage thrives on high-cost, high-impact spells. Use resource-boosting cards like Temporal Insight and Arcane Reserve to maintain your momentum.<br>
                    <strong>Control the Battlefield:</strong> Utilize stuns, turn order manipulation (Chrono Disruption), and buffs to keep the upper hand. Combine Temporal Shield with defensive play to mitigate incoming damage.<br>
                    <strong>Lore Mechanics:</strong> Plan your use of Lore-enhanced cards strategically. They can turn a good spell into a game-changing move but often come with steep costs.
